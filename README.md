🧠 POS Taggers

This project showcases the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using spaCy, a modern and powerful NLP library in Python. POS tagging is a fundamental step in understanding the grammatical structure of sentences and is crucial for various downstream NLP tasks like parsing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

🔍 Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized how we interact with digital systems by enabling them to understand and generate human language in a meaningful and contextually relevant way.

📌 Why POS Tagging Matters

✅ Enables syntactic parsing for grammar analysis

✅ Supports semantic understanding and information extraction

✅ Aids in text classification, NER, and machine translation

🧠 spaCy-Based POS Tagging

spaCy is an industrial-strength NLP library that supports POS tagging through statistical models trained on large annotated datasets.

⚙️ Key Features

🏷️ Universal POS tags + detailed fine-grained tags

💡 Human-readable tag explanations with spacy.explain(tag)

🌍 Multilingual model support (English, German, Spanish, French, etc.)

🧩 Extendable for other languages or custom models
